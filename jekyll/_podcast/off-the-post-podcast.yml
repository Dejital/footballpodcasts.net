description: "The Off The Post Podcast is a sachet of Premiership-focused mp3-gold; a full-plate of scuffed facts with a drizzle of puns laid on a bed of unconventional and entirely unhelpful observations. Although glitz, glamour, goals and abysmal haircuts in England’s top-tier get most of our attention, rest assured - if a player scores an own goal with his backside in the Uzbekistani conference league – this is where you’ll receive an in-depth analysis and a search for an existential meaning behind it. If a beer-goggled 2 Good 2 Bad were to lay down with a half-decent episode of Soccer AM, the OTP podcast would be the resulting illegitimate love child."
